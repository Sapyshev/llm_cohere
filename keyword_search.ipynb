The production received mixed reviews which noted Robeson's \"highly civilized quality <nowiki>[but lacking the]</nowiki> grand style.\" Robeson stated the best way to diminish the oppression African Americans faced was for his artistic work to be an example of what \"men of my colour\" could accomplish rather than to \"be a propagandist and make speeches and write articles about what they call the Colour Question.\"\n",

Stone said that her record company also fought her about the original cover of her new album, calling it \"offensive\". It was changed to simple text and no picture of Stone on the American edition. The original cover was used on the other editions worldwide. In late August 2010, it was reported that Stone had left EMI and formed her own independent record label, Stone'd Records. EMI announced in late December that they would be releasing a greatest hits album, \"The Best of Joss Stone 2003–2009\". The compilation was released on 30 September 2011.\n",
